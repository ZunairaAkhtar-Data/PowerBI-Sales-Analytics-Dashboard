# E-Commerce Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard

## Subject
Practice project created to gain real-world experience in Power BI data analysis and dashboard development.

## Problem Statement
The business has historical sales data containing information about orders, customers, products, cities, and payment methods.  
However, the raw data does not clearly explain sales performance, customer behavior, or transaction patterns.  
Without proper analysis and visualization, it is difficult to extract meaningful insights for business decision-making.

- What are the total sales, total transactions, and total quantity sold?
- How do sales vary across different cities and regions?
- What is the monthly sales and quantity trend?
- How are customers distributed across different rating levels?
- Which payment methods are most frequently used?
- Which mobile brands and models generate the highest sales?
- On which days of the week are sales highest?
